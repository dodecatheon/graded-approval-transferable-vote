This code is an independently reimplemented simplification of Jameson
Quinn's PR-MCA, AKA Approval Threshold Transferable Vote (AT-TV), to
which he retains copyright.

The main difference is that my version is straight ER-Bucklin, while
JQ selects a different candidate from among those whose Bucklin score
exceeds the quota.

Two other minor differences:

(a) I calculate the rescale factor based on locksums (see below); and
(b) I use a slightly different Droop quota than either Quinn or standard
    Droop.

Majority Choice Approval is described here:

and here:

By ER-Bucklin or MCA(M), we mean here that one uses Range (AKA Score) ballots,
and any rating between 0 and the maximum range can be given to any candidate
("equal rank allowed").  By default, the maximum rating is 5 (as in a Majority
Judgement ballot).  The equivalent of Bucklin first place is the maximum
score.  The "(M)" means that we seat the highest Bucklin-scoring candidate
whose score exceeds the quota (Majority criterion).

MCAMTV is similar to STV, with equal ranking allowed, but there are
some key differences:

  In STV,

  * There must be exactly one candidate at each rank.

  * There can be no gaps in ranks, though lower ranks do not have to be
    filled in.

  * The only way for lower ranked candidates to be counted is for
    candidates in higher ranks to be eliminated or seated, at which
    time lower ranks are moved up one rank.

  * When no candidate's score exceeds the quota, the only way to
    increase the vote strength of other candidates is to eliminate the
    candidate with lowest top-rank score and move other candidates on
    that ballot up one rank.

  In ER-BucklinTV/MCAMTV,

  * Equal ranking is allowed.

  * It is not necessary to fill in a candidate for each rating level.

  * When no candidate's score exceeds the quota, it is not necessary
    to eliminate lower-ranked candidates.  To increase the number of
    top-ranked candidates, the approval threshold is successively
    lowered for all candidates until at least one candidate exceeds
    the quota.

  * It is not necessary to automatically uprank scores on individual
    ballots, after either seating or elimination, because top-rank
    counts are done approval style.  Therefore we simply count a
    ballot for a candidate if that candidate's score exceeds the
    threshold.

  * The basic philosophy of the approval threshold is that you wait until
    every candidate has had a chance for their top-ranked candidates to make
    the quota and win a seat.  When everyone has had a chance but no one
    reaches quota, you then lower the approval threshold for every candidate
    at the same time.

    This decreases strategic voting incentives when compared to STV.

Background:

A similar Bucklin Transferable Vote idea described by Abd ul-Rahman
Lomax in this post, but he followed the STV approach of upranking when
a candidate was seated and reverted to Asset voting for the last seat
if no candidate makes the quota.

Since this goes against the ER-Bucklin philosophy of giving everyone
the same approval threshold change at the same time, this scheme is no
longer "Bucklin".

Both MCAMTV and STV transfer would make the same over-quota transfer
[(candidate_total - quota)/candidate_total], but I include an extra
correction to take account of locked ballots:

    over-vote rescale factor = (T - Q) / (T - L),
                               constrained to be between 0.0 and 1.0

Glossary, following the analogy of musical chairs:

Seated:      A candidate has met the quota and won a seat.

Standing:    Candidate has not met quota and is still in the running.

Locked:      A candidate's vote becomes locked on a single ballot when the
             ballot has only one standing candidate left.

             If that single candidate is seated, there are no other
             candidates to transfer the overquota vote to.

             If a candidate's score is locked on a ballot on the first
             round, the ballot is called a bullet vote -- the voter
             picked a single candidate.

             But it can also happen when all other choices on the
             ballot have already been seated.  Then if candidate A
             receives an overvote and the ballot is removed entirely,
             the ballot's excess score for A is not transferable.

Locksums:    The sum of locked scores for a candidate determine how much
             of the candidate's total score can be rescaled and
             redistributed in the event of being seated with an
             overquota.  If the total approved score for the candidate
             is B, the quota is Q, and the candidate's locksum is L,
             the over-vote rescaling is (B-Q)/(B-L), for Q > L.  If L
             > Q, no rescaling transfer is possible and L-Q of the
             vote is lost.

Bucklin score:  The total number of ballots on which a candidate has
             a score over the threshold.

Algorithm:

There are N valid ballots and M seats to fill.

Begin with threshold at max score and rescale factor at 1.0 for each
ballot.  Set the quota:  The M-seat Droop quota is

    (floor[(N*M)/(M+1)] + 1) / M

Repeat until M candidates have been seated or threshold cannot be
lowered any further:

  Compute Bucklin Score:
    For each candidate,
       Repeat while threshold > 0
          Accumulate weighted total of ballots with score above threshold
          If any total is above the quota, break loop,
          Otherwise lower threshold by 1

  Seat candidate with highest Bucklin score (B)

  Rescale unlocked ballots containing that candidate to transfer
  over-quota vote, by multiplying the ballot strength by

      Factor = min(max(B-Q,0)/max(B-L,eps),1)

In the event that the threshold drops to zero and there is no candidate with
Bucklin score B over the quota, we simply seat the candidate with highest
approval (Bucklin score with all non-zero ranks counted) and remove all
ballots containing that candidate.

The Factor formula above handles the contingency that the Bucklin threshold
has gone to zero with no one over quota.  In that case, the rescake Factor is
zero.

Usage:

There are some example csv ballots available in my Cumulative Tranferable Vote
project.  I'm duplicating them here.

Here's how to run them:

June 2011 example from
http://rangevoting.org/June2011RealWorldRRVvotes.txt

  ./mcamtv.py -n 9 -m 9 -q droop -i june2011.csv -o june2011_output.csv


Stephen Unger's STV example, from
http://rangevoting.org/STVPRunger.html

  ./mcamtv.py -n 3 -m 4 -q droop -i unger.csv -o unger_output.csv


A sample ballot from the CTV project:

./mcamtv.py -n 5 -m 10 -q droop -i new_sample.csv -o new_sample_output.csv


The csv output file contains a table with the intermediate Bucklin scores as
the score level is lowered to the threshold.  Each score is listed as

   #.#### (position)

where the number in parentheses is the rank of the Bucklin score.  If the
score with rank (1) exceeds the quota, that candidate is seated.
